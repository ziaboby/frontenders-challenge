# Challenge #8 - Pixit

Create a layout with three components, a navbar, a colour palette and a canvas.

The app lets you choose a colour and draw on the canvas by pressing the mouse.

Colour can be changed more times.

In the navbar there are two inputs of type number to change the width and height of the pixel.

There is a reset button to reset the initial state.

# Bonus

Save the drawing as image
