# Challenge #10 - Life In Dots

This challenge is inspired by this article: https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

The user inserts their birth date and can visualize how much life has been spent based on a life span of 90 years.

The visualization is through a grid in three modalities:

- weeks, each row shows 52 squares (1 year);
- months: each row shows 36 squares (3 years);
- years: each row shows 10 squares (10 years).

## Bonus

You can show the death of famous people in the grid to see if you lived more or less.
Or you can show the grid with different colours based on the life cycle (childhood, elementary school, middle school, high school, university, work, old age)
